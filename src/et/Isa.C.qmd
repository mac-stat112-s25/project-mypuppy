The reading that I was looking at listed 8 Simple Characteristics of a Great Team. 
I believe that individual strengths, open communication, and strong conflict resolution are three of the most important qualities of a great team.
When each team member is encouraged to bring their unique skills and strengths to the table, the team becomes more diverse in its capabilities and more effective in solving problems. 
Open communication helps build trust and ensures that everyone feels heard and included, which is essential for collaboration and shared decision-making. 
At the same time, strong conflict resolution skills allow the team to handle disagreements in a healthy, constructive way, preventing misunderstandings from growing into larger issues. 
Together, these qualities create a team culture that supports growth, accountability, and mutual respectâ€”one where everyone is empowered to contribute and succeed.
