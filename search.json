    "text": "Motivation\nIn a world where dogs are considered not just pets but beloved family members, understanding what drives the popularity of certain breeds offers a unique lens into broader societal trends. This project began with a simple question: Why do some dog breeds surge in popularity while others quietly fade from the spotlight? As dog ownership continues to rise across the U.S.—particularly among millennials and Gen Z—shifting breed preferences reflect larger lifestyle changes, including increased urban living, smaller households, and a growing emphasis on emotional well-being.\nBeyond curiosity, this project has real-world relevance. For pet industry professionals, breeders, shelters, and prospective dog owners, identifying the traits linked to breed popularity can inform smarter decisions, from breeding strategies to adoption campaigns. Culturally, it invites us to consider how our evolving relationships with animals mirror the ways our lives and values are changing.",

    "text": "America’s Dog Preferences Are Changing: Who’s Gaining — and Who’s Dropping — in Popularity?\nBetween 2013 and 2020, America’s taste in dogs shifted notably, with certain breeds climbing the popularity ranks and others quietly fading from favor. A recent data analysis from the American Kennel Club’s breed rankings reveals telling trends in canine preferences, hinting at evolving lifestyle needs, aesthetic tastes, and family dynamics.\nOverall Trend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA line chart tracking the top five rising dog breeds shows a clear upward trajectory in popularity between 2013 and 2020. Breeds such as the Beaucerons, Belgian Malinois, and Cane Corso experienced significant gains, with some jumping more than 20 spots in national ranking.\nThese breeds tend to be medium to large in size, loyal, quiet, and have high scores in affection and trainability—characteristics increasingly favored by urban middle class and suburban pet owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis second line chart tracking the top five falling dog breeds shows a consistent downward trend in popularity between 2013 and 2020. Breeds such as the American English Coonhounds, Chinooks, Salukis, Irish Water Spaniels, and Treeing Walker Coonhounds all dropped significantly in rank over this period.\nThese breeds are often more specialized in function—such as hunting or field work—and may require more space, exercise, or grooming than the average household pet owner prefers. As lifestyles become more urbanized and convenience-focused, these traits may make such breeds less compatible with modern pet ownership, contributing to their decline in popularity.\nWhy Some Breeds Are Gaining or Losing Popularity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart compares average trait scores between rising and falling dog breeds across 15 characteristics. Rising breeds score higher in Trainability, Playfulness, Affection With Family, and Adaptability, indicating a preference for dogs that are easier to train, more sociable, and better suited to modern lifestyles.\nIn contrast, falling breeds tend to score higher in Protective Nature, Drooling, and Grooming Needs, suggesting they require more maintenance and may be less compatible with urban or busy households.\nOverall, the data points to a shift toward low-maintenance, affectionate, and adaptable dogs, reflecting changing owner preferences in today’s living environments.\nTraits That Define Today’s Most (and Least) Popular Dogs\nContinue with previous visualizations, we know what type of dogs are popular and have made a summary of them, but what are their specific characteristics? In the chart titled “Trait Comparison: Top 10 vs. Bottom 10 Dog Breeds,” we compared the behavioral and physical traits of the most popular breeds with those at the bottom of the popularity list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few standout trends emerged: Top 10 breeds (like the Beaucerons and Belgian) scored much higher on: Affectionate With Family Good With Children Trainability Playfulness Bottom 10 breeds were more likely to have: Higher Shedding Levels Greater Grooming Needs Lower Scores for Adaptability and Energy This suggests a clear preference for dogs that are easy to care for, eager to please, and great with families. Breeds that are more high-maintenance or aloof — even if charming in their own right — may be falling out of step with modern lifestyles.\n###Grouping Dog Breeds by Traits: What Makes a Breed Popular? {.unnumbered}\nK-means/Elbow Method/Clusters\nK-Means Clustering: This is a machine learning method used to group similar items (in this case, dog breeds) based on multiple numeric traits. It helps uncover hidden groupings or “types” of dogs that might not align with traditional breed groupings. Popularity Shift (Rank Change): Defined as the difference in a breed’s ranking between 2013 and 2020. A positive value indicates rising popularity, and a negative value shows decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach cluster = a behavioral or personality profile. You can describe them as:\nThe active adventurers The chill lap dogs The obedient family dogs The aloof independents\nCluster 1: High trainability, affectionate, moderate energy → “Family-Friendly, Obedient Breeds” Cluster 2: Super high energy, low trainability → “High-Drive Working Dogs”\n️Cluster 3: Low energy, low shedding → “Laid-Back Companions”\nCluster 4: High grooming needs, moderate traits → “Show Dogs or Fancy Breeds”\nAnalyzing the clusters 2-D dimensions visualization and the average popularity rank by traits together we can know, cluster 1 and 3 stand out. Cluster 1 (Family Dogs) had by far the lowest average rank, making them the most popular group. Cluster 2 (Adventurers) and Cluster 4 (Show Dogs) lagged behind, possibly due to their high energy or grooming requirements. Cluster 3 (Lap Dogs) occupied the middle ground, offering a good compromise for many owners.\nTrait Profiles Reveal Cluster Personalities\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 16\n  cluster Affectionate With Fami…¹ Good With Young Chil…² `Good With Other Dogs`\n  &lt;fct&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1                           3.69                   3.23                   3.31\n2 2                           5                      4.64                   3.91\n3 3                           4.64                   3.82                   3.09\n4 4                           4.5                    3.57                   3.29\n# ℹ abbreviated names: ¹​`Affectionate With Family`, ²​`Good With Young Children`\n# ℹ 12 more variables: `Shedding Level` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Coat Grooming Frequency` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Drooling Level` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Openness To Strangers` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Playfulness Level` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Watchdog/Protective Nature` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Adaptability Level` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Trainability Level` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Energy Level` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Barking Level` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Mental Stimulation Needs` &lt;dbl&gt;, rank &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nThis table highlights how different breed clusters vary in sociability traits. Cluster 2 breeds are the most affectionate and family-friendly, making them ideal for households with children or multiple pets. In contrast, Cluster 1 shows the lowest scores in these traits, suggesting more independent or less social breeds. These distinctions help explain why certain clusters may be more popular with modern dog owners.\nConclusion\nIn the evolving world of pet ownership, America’s favorite dogs reflect more than just cuteness or tradition — they mirror our values, lifestyles, and changing daily realities. Through breed popularity data and trait analysis, a clear narrative emerges: the most beloved dog breeds today are those that are loyal, affectionate, adaptable, and easy to live with.\nMachine learning deepened that story, revealing four distinct canine “personality clusters” — from the reliable, trainable family dogs to the independent show dogs and high-energy workers. The most popular breeds overwhelmingly came from clusters that emphasized emotional connection, low maintenance, and versatility, aligning with trends toward urban living, work-from-home routines, and active family dynamics.\nUltimately, this project underscores a simple truth: as our lives evolve, so do our choices in companionship. Today’s top dogs aren’t just pets — they’re partners, confidants, and reflections of who we are.\nLimitations\nWhile this project provides valuable insights into dog breed popularity trends, several limitations should be noted. First, the breed trait data is not time-stamped and assumes that traits remain static over time, which may not reflect evolving breed characteristics or owner perceptions. Second, the AKC registration data only includes purebred dogs registered in the U.S., potentially excluding popular mixed breeds or dogs registered under alternative systems. Lastly, the trait scores are somewhat subjective and based on generalizations, which may not capture the full range of variation within a breed. These factors may limit the generalizability of the findings to all dog owners or international contexts.\nVideo Report\nWatch the video\nPresentation Slide\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.

I believe that individual strengths, open communication, and strong conflict resolution are three of the most important qualities of a great team. When each team member is encouraged to bring their unique skills and strengths to the table, the team becomes more diverse in its capabilities and more effective in solving problems. Open communication helps build trust and ensures that everyone feels heard and included, which is essential for collaboration and shared decision-making. At the same time, strong conflict resolution skills allow the team to handle disagreements in a healthy, constructive way, preventing misunderstandings from growing into larger issues.

    "text": "Project Name: My Puppy Team Members: Isa, Sylvie, Bethany Short Description: This project explores how dog breed popularity in the U.S. changed from 2013 to 2020, and what traits are linked to those changes. We found that rising breeds tend to be more affectionate, trainable, and adaptable, while falling breeds often require more grooming or are less family-friendly. Inspiration: We all love dogs so we decided to do a project on it. Plan: First week: work on possible ideas for plots and codes. Second week: finalize codes and work on presentation. Isa and Sylvie will work on the codes and Bethany will work on the miscellaneous things.",
